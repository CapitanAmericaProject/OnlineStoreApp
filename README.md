	Online store application

	The application is made for managing a real online store for electronical products, appliances and their manual books for usage.
  It provides the scope for a customer to log in at the online app, view the different products and their technical specifications, 
  and finally, buy particular product by adding it to the customer's own online shopping cart. On the other hand, the app provides 
  the opption admin user to log in and manage different activities due to the store needs - for example changing a product's price, 
  or recieving the messages left at the store's online forum.
  
	Through different implementations, the app ensures that the logged customer can use the numerous functionalities of the store - 
  view the product's description and image /presented as a string/; add and remove product from the shopping cart; 
  take a discount by paying through credit card; choose a different colour for samo products; add comments for others, 
  and finally share likes for particular products.
  
	The app also maintains a message forum where every visitor /not only logged cusotmers/ can post messages and images - 
  for example, asking for a price for particular product, or checking the stock of other.
